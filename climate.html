    <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Climate change is defined as a long-term change in both climates and weather worldwide. Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and "fluorinated gasses" like hydrofluorocarbon cause sunlight as heat to be trapped on the Earth. Burning fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, mining and producing goods, cutting down trees, combustion in cars, and also cattle and some fertilizers can emit harmful gases.</p>

    <h2>The Affects of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>The heating of the globe has many unwanted and catastrophic side effects. Hotter temperatures can cause more droughts, leading to more world hunger. Events like hurricanes and extreme rainfall are bolstered because of how the heat evaporates moisture faster. Warming of the poles causes the seas to rise and acidify, killing both sea life and land dwellers.</p>

    <h2>The Prevention of Climate Change</h2>
    <p>To stop climate change, the best way is to cut using fossil fuels and rely on more renewable energies like wind, solar, and water-powered energies. We also need to support natural ecosystems that can intake CO2 so that it doesn't trap heat. Funding is crucial to create technologies and also help developing countries keep their emissions in check.</p>
